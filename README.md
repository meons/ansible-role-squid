=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-squid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-squid)

  become: true

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.squid

```

--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for squid

#squid_cache_dir: aufs /var/spool/squid 16000 16 256 max-size=8589934592
squid_cache_dir: ufs /var/spool/squid 100 16 256

squid_ignore_docker: yes

```
